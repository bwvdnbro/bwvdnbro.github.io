In a [previous post]({% post_url 
2019-01-06-tools-i-use-for-scientific-code-development %}), I already 
covered the main tools I use during the scientific code development 
process. These tools were all closely related to writing, testing and 
maintaining code. In this post, I will cover tools that help with 
running code efficiently. These are tools that allow you to run whatever 
you want to run more efficiently, faster and more securely, and that 
also allow you to rerun things in a more effective way if required.

# Automation tools

## batch systems
