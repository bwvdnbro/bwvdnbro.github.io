During the past few years, I have conducted or been involved with quite 
a few astrophysical simulation projects. Despite being very different in 
subject (some of these simulations involved single stars, while others 
covered entire galaxies), I noticed these projects always roughly 
followed the same steps. Some of these steps were very obvious, while I 
only became aware of others after a few projects.

Generally, the steps you follow to complete some task are what we call a 
*workflow*. Basically everyone that does something is executing some 
workflow, but most people are not aware of that fact. And while being 
aware of your workflow does not necessarily make the workflow any easier 
to execute, it sometimes helps to improve it, or to make it more 
efficient.

Below I will try to give an overview of my typical workflow during an 
astrophysical simulation project. Workflows are usually very specific to 
a certain task and maybe even to a certain person, so I cannot promise 
that this workflow will be of any help. But then again, you never 
know...

# Step 1: design/study phase

Every project starts with an idea. This idea does not have to be your 
own (in fact, if you are an early career researcher, it usually isn't). 
The idea is a very vague plan for something to do, and can be based on 
various things: a discussion with a fellow scientist, a paper you 
recently read, or just something you came up with in the shower that 
morning.

In this first step, you need to make this vague plan more concrete. And 
the best way to do this is by digging into the library, or, more 
correctly, into some online search engine.
